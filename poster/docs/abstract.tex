Estimating the concentration matrix, i.e. the inverse of covariance matrix, is vital in graphical model structure inference. The common practice may subject to the multiple testing problems, inconsistent parameter estimation and other issues. However, when we assume that the underlying probabilistic model is Gaussian, then it would be possible to perform likelihood based methods to estimate the concentration matrix, without even restoring the graph structure beforehand. When the graph is not complete, there are some entries in the concentrate matrix being zero. Lasso-like penalized method will detect these zero terms help reducing the number of parameters to be estimated, and also leads to the correct graph structure. Thus, in this approach model selection and parameter estimation are done at the same time, which is the main strength. The computation is eased by exploiting maxdet algorithm. BIC-type criterion is applied to the selection of tuning parameter in the penalized term.
